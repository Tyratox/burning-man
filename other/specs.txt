goal of an agent:
    arrive at shelter/escape the building

signs:
    probability P(agent takes the right path):
        clearness
        visibility (smoke)
    activation of fire alarm (time)
    gravity

paths:
    shortest path
    detour 
    dead end -> change direction
    obstacle -> detour (fire destroied some part of the building)

agent:
    fitness
    position
    stress level
    weight
    diameter
    direction
    speed
    acceleration
    determination -> drops after a while not seeing a sign
    group

groups:
    nr of agents
    determination
    direction
    average speed
    acceleration

fire:
    starting area
    growing rate
    growing direction

smoke:
    changes direction of an agent/destroys group
    source (fire)
    growing rate

area next to fire:
    probability P(taking fire) -> dependent of direction of fire, material,...
